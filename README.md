## Hi there 👋
I’m Archana Singh, **Senior Software Engineer**, cloud architect, and .NET enthusiast.

## What I do
- I specialise in backend engineering and cloud architecture 
- Design scalable, high-performance .NET applications
- Adopt clean architecture and modern DevOps automation
- Build systems that are secure, observable, and maintainable.

## Focusing on:
- Building distributed systems and RESTful APIs with .NET 7/8, ASP.NET Core, EF Core 
- Designing microservices and modular monoliths with DDD and CQRS principles
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps & GitHub Actions 
- Securing cloud applications with Azure AD, OAuth2, and Key Vault 
- Optimising SQL and API performance for data-heavy enterprise systems 

Every day, I apply Clean Architecture, OOP/SOLID principles and automate testing to deliver software that scales and lasts.

## My Focus Areas
## Core Stack:
C#, .NET 8, ASP.NET Core, Web API, Entity Framework Core

## Architecture:
Clean Architecture, Microservices, Modular Monolith, DDD, CQRS, Event-Driven Design

## Cloud & DevOps:
Azure App Service, Azure SQL, Blob Storage, Key Vault, Azure Functions, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps Pipelines, Docker

## Database & Integration:
SQL Server, REST APIs, Messaging (RabbitMQ/Service Bus), Caching (Redis)

## Testing & Quality:
Unit and Integration Testing, NUnit, xUnit, Moq,

## Frontend:
HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery 

## Engineering Principles
- **Automate everything:** builds, tests, and deployments
- **Design for failure:** resilience and observability first
- **Measure everything:** structured logs and telemetry with Application Insights
- **Ship often: faster** iteration cycles through CI/CD
- **Code for humans:** clarity and maintainability above all

## Current Focus
- Upgrading legacy systems to .NET 8 microservices
- Implementing zero-downtime deployments via Azure DevOps
- Designing observability pipelines with Serilog and Application Insights
- Applying DDD tactical patterns for modular system design
